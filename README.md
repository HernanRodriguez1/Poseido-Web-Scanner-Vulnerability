# Poseidon Web-Scanner Vulnerability

Poseidon Web Scanner Vulnerability 1.0  - It is a nuclei-based Python vulnerability scanner.
Currently uses the following features:
- Import YAML files to generate the vulnerability response match
- Import a TXT where the parameters to fuzz are found
- Allows importing multiple urls for vulnerability scanning
- Currently you can add the number of threads
- Allows authenticated scanning through cookies.
- It supports TLS in all its versions.

Create your own templates in YAML and have fun with this tool with few lines of code!

Compatible: Linux / Windows

Configurate lines for the requets in archive TXT example: 

fuzzingSQL.txt
```sh
*
-
'
')
`))
``
;
//
' AND id IS NULL; --
/*â€¦*/
-x()
[1]
/!1111'/
+
1 or 1
```

Configurate match based in response example:
archivo.yaml
```sh
 extractors:
      - type: regex
        part: body
        regex:
          - "SQL syntax.*?MySQL"
          - "Warning.*?\\Wmysqli?_"
          - "MySQLSyntaxErrorException"
          - "valid MySQL result"
```
!Attention!: For correct operation, you must respect the architecture of the design: }
```sh
 extractors:
      - type: regex
        part: body
        regex:
```

## Testing Fuzzing GET

In the first instance they must collect the urls with the GET parameters.

## Testing Poseidon Web Scanning Vulnerability

```sh
python3 Poseidon.py -d urls.txt -t 10 -f archivo.yaml -q fuzzingSQL.txt  -c "PHPSESSID=afd4f7j5nerfg45dg37rhj01"
```

All urls that return are vulnerable.

## Enjoy the tool, if possible improve it.
